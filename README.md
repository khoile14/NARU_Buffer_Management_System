# NARU Buffer Management System
The NARU Buffer Management System is a project from the System Programming Course. This project entails the implementation of a sophisticated buffer processing system in C, designed specifically to manage multiple-word buffers similar to open files. It aims to enhance user interaction with textual data and includes a comprehensive set of features such as buffer creation, modification, file input/output operations, and the execution of user-specified programs, all within a Unix-like environment. Furthermore, the system is engineered to efficiently handle an arbitrary number of concurrent processes, utilizing advanced mechanisms for process control through pipes and signals. Developed exclusively for the Zeus system, the project prioritizes compatibility and performance, ensuring seamless integration and optimal functionality within the designated environment.
